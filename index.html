        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <article class="about-me">
          <p>
            I wasn´t alsways a tech enthusiast, but that changed in 2017 when I
            was offered a job at an Online Shop as an office assistant. Shortly
            into the job my boss discovered my talent for details and creativity
            and so she gave me the free hand to express it and soon I was doing
            the job of an Online Marketing Manager without realising it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I discovered the vast possibilities embedded in the cyber space and
            I didn´t need to be an expert to realise that, that is where the
            future lies and there I promissed myself that I was going to get
            deeper into it than just what I knew back then. <br />
            The first opportunity presented itself in 2019 where I was offered a
            placement at WBS to hone my softskills. It was a six months
            intensive Business Administration course and two of those were
            dedicated to MS Office. And as a follow up, I did another six months
            intensive online marketing course at the same institution in 2020
            where I trained to become an Online Marketing Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I didn´t stop there. I embarked on a self-learning journey to
            becoming a programmer in 2021 while at the same time working as a
            sales rep at an insurance firm. I liked my job, but it wasn´t what I
            really wanted, so the firm and I agreed to end our working
            relationship and in January I applied for the Web Development course
            at Neue Fische, which is where I currently am, and I was delighted
            to be accepted to this course that is bound to open many prospects,
            because my aim is to become a Java Developer, and I hope that I´ll
            also get an admission to the Java Development course in this same
            institution after this one.
